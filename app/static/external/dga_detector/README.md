DGA Domains detection

DGA domain detection is based on ngram analysis with trained markov chain model.
It is incorporate code by https://github.com/rrenaud/Gibberish-Detector

The decision is based solely on results by this check.

In addition to ngram analysis it is also provide additional methods:
* entropy - High entropy is another indicator of DGA domain. Threshold is 3.8
* consonants - High consonants count is an indicator of DGA domain. Threshold is 7
* length - High domain length can also indicate DGA. Threshold is 12.
